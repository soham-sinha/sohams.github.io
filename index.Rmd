I am Research Assistant (RA) in the Department of Population Health Sciences at the Joan and Sanford I Weill Medical College of Cornell University. In my current role, I am working with Dr. Ravi Sharaf, MD on projects exploring cost-effective ways to screen the population for germline cancers, and I am also working on projects modelling the incidence of colorectal cancer in the US population.

In addition to being a RA, I am also a part-time Teaching Associate in the department. In this role, I primarily teach students in the MS programs in Population Health Sciences and students in the executive M.B.A./M.S. in Healthcare Leadership program offered jointly by Cornell's Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management and the Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences.


I am an economist by training. I completed a Masters degree in Health Policy and Economics from the Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences. Prior to this, I got a Master of Science in Economics from the London School of Economics, and a Bachelor of Science in Economics from the University of Manchester.
